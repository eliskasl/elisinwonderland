Setup
-----
Install and activate - pretty straight forward! 

Color selection is available under the Customize option in the Appearance menu, but colours also can be edited quickly if youâ€™re using Scss by changing the following variables in assets/css/scss/_base.scss and recompiling:

$primary-color
$secondary-color
$tertiary-color

The SCSS uses the newest versions of Compass and Susy as of March 4th, 2014.

Note that galleries use prettyPhoto, and default to linking directly to the file.  Linking to the attachment page is disabled.


The slider implementation is basic.  It appears on the front page, and you can set the tag you want to use to flag posts for inclusion in the WordPress customizer.
